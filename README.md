# PRODIGY_ML_04

**Task:** Developed a Hand Gesture Recognition model that accurately identifies and classifies different hand gestures from image or video data, enabling intuitive human-computer interaction and gesture-based control systems.

**My Learnings Throughout the Implementation:**

âš¡ **Leveled Up My Gesture Recognition Skills ðŸ“ˆ:** Analyzed the LeapGestureRecog dataset on Kaggle to understand human movement patterns using machine learning. Built and trained models to classify different gestures with image/video data. #MachineLearning #GestureRecognition

ðŸ“Š **Data Wizardry & Model Mastermind âœ¨:** Prepped the data for training (resizing, normalization, and augmentation). Explored different architectures to find the optimal model for gesture recognition. #DataScience #DeepLearning

ðŸ”° **Metrics Make the Magic Happen ðŸŽ›:** Evaluated model performance using precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure accuracy. Visualized the model's behavior for a deeper understanding.

ðŸ’· **Ready for the Real World!** Gained valuable experience for real-world applications of gesture recognition in human-computer interaction.
